## Life Cycles

#### The Systems Development Life Cycle, Is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. 

## WaterFall Method (Sequential)

#### The waterfall is a sequentian non-iterative design model , used in software development proccesses. The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and construction industries; where the highly structured physical environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive much sooner in the development process. It is basically a Step by Step guide that will help you though if you were to get stuck it can help you though as it will tell you what’s next.  

#### The first known time that the Water fall method was used was by sHerbert D. on advanced programming methods for digital computers on 29 June 1956.

### Advantages
* The advantages of the waterfall model consist of the simple methodology and structure behind the model, making it easy to understand and use as like a waterfall the proccessess only flow one way not branching back or off the rythm or flow.
* Very good for short projects
* People understand the technology

### Disadvantages
* Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage.
* Not a good model for complex and long projects
* No working software till the end of the cycle
* No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.

### Example Of Using The Waterfall Method 
#### The Development team analyzes the requirements set by the customer. They must fully understand the problems as well as the positives. This is a research phase that includes no building. The team attempts to ask all the questions and secure all the answers they need to build the product requirement. The Software team design a technical solution to the problems set out by the product requirements which includes scenarios, layouts and data models. This phase is usually accompanied by documentation for each requirement, which enables other members of the team to review it for validation
#### Once the design is approved the technical implementation begins. This is normally the shortest phase because research and design have been done in advance. Upon completion of full implementation, testing needs to take place before the product can be released to customers. The software testing team will use the design documents, personas and user case scenarios delivered by the product manager in order to create their test cases.


## Spiral Method (Iterative)

#### The spiral model is a risk-driven process model generator for software projects. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models. The Spiral model has four different phases which the project repeatedly passes though. The four phases are Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering and Evaluation. The software passes though these starting with the planning phase where the requirements are gathered. Next is risk where it identifys the risk and alternate solutions and a prototype is produced. The Engineering Phase is the development phase along with some testing at the end of the phase. But the development and testing is done separately in the phase. Then the final phase is Evaluation. In this phase it allows the customer to see the finished project before it then goes though the cycle again or to the next spiral.


### Advantages 

* High amount of risk analysis hence, avoidance of Risk is enhanced
* Good for large and mission-critical projects
* Additional Functionality can be added at a later date

### Disadvantages

* Can be a costly model to use.
* Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise.
* Project’s success is highly dependent on the risk analysis phase

### How Risk Is Managed

#### The Spiral Model is costly to use and dosent work well for small projects. it is a risk event driven model. This means that the overall project lies on the success of the risk analysis. The first step is to identify the risk so you know what you are working with, the second step is to see how dangerous the risk is between low risk and high risk and how urgent It needs to be acted upon within the project by listing them in importance, the third risk is to monitor the risk to see if it has happened or happening now. The next step is if the risk has happened then you need to act upon on it if the risk has not happened yet then you continue to repeat the third step of monitoring it. Then you need to keep on monitoring till the end. Once at the end your prototype is produced.


## Prototyping (Iterative)

#### Prototyping refers to the creating of software applications at early stages of development, for example, incomplete versions of the software program being developed. It is an activity that can occur in software development. It used to visualize some component of the software to limit the gap of misunderstanding the customer requirements by the development team. This also will reduce the iterations may occur in waterfall approach and hard to be implemented due to the inflexibility of the waterfall approach. So, when the final prototype is developed, the requirement is considered to be frozen.

### Advantages

* Reduced time and costs, but this can be a disadvantage if the developer loses time in developing the prototypes.
* Improved and increased user involvement.

### Disadvantages 

* Insufficient analysis· User confusion of prototype and finished system.
* Developer misunderstanding of user objectives.
* Excessive development time of the prototype.
* Expense of implementing prototyping


## V Model (Sequentail)

#### V Model is an SDLC model where execution of processes happens in the shape of a V. Hence the name. V Model is also known as Verification and Validation model.
#### The V Model is an Extension from the waterfall model which I have talked about above. It is based on the testing phase for each development stage. This means that every phase in the cycle is tested and it will only move on to the next phase once it has completed the one before. There are two different side of the V. One is Verification Phases and the other is Validation Phases. Then at the Bottom of the V the Coding Phase joins the two sides together.

### Advantages:
* Easy / Simple to use
* Testing happens before coding. This can save time by stopping you from running into problems when coding 
* Works well for small projects
* Proactive Defect Tracking. Meaning The problems are found early on
* Avoids the downward flow of the defects 
* Helps with keeping you on track and time management 

### Disadvantages:
* If you decide to change something midway, then the testing and requirement documentation has to change.
* Poor Model for long ongoing Projects. As Changes can happen
* High Risk 
* No Working Software is produced till late on in the cycle
