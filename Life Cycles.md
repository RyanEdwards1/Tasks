## Life Cycles

#### The Systems Development Life Cycle, Is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. 

### WaterFall Method 

#### The waterfall is a sequentian non-iterative design model , used in software development proccesses. The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and construction industries; where the highly structured physical environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive much sooner in the development process.

#### The first known time that the Water fall method was used was by sHerbert D. on advanced programming methods for digital computers on 29 June 1956.

### Advantages
#### The advantages of the waterfall model consist of the simple methodology and structure behind the model, making it easy to understand and use as like a waterfall the proccessess only flow one way not branching back or off the rythm or flow.

### Disadvantages
#### Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage.

#### No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.


### Spiral Method

#### The spiral model is a risk-driven process model generator for software projects. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models.

#### This model was first described by Barry Boehm in his 1986 paper Called A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement.

### Advantages 

#### High amount of risk analysis hence, avoidance of Risk is enhanced
#### Good for large and mission-critical projects
#### Additional Functionality can be added at a later date

### Disadvantages

#### Can be a costly model to use.
#### Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise.
#### Projectâ€™s success is highly dependent on the risk analysis phase
