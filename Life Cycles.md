## Life Cycles

#### The Systems Development Life Cycle, Is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. 

## WaterFall Method 

#### The waterfall is a sequentian non-iterative design model , used in software development proccesses. The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and construction industries; where the highly structured physical environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive much sooner in the development process.

#### The first known time that the Water fall method was used was by sHerbert D. on advanced programming methods for digital computers on 29 June 1956.

### Advantages
#### The advantages of the waterfall model consist of the simple methodology and structure behind the model, making it easy to understand and use as like a waterfall the proccessess only flow one way not branching back or off the rythm or flow.

### Disadvantages
#### Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage.

#### No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.

### Example Of Using The Waterfall Method 
#### The Development team analyzes the requirements set by the customer. They must fully understand the problems as well as the positives. This is a research phase that includes no building. The team attempts to ask all the questions and secure all the answers they need to build the product requirement. The Software team design a technical solution to the problems set out by the product requirements which includes scenarios, layouts and data models. This phase is usually accompanied by documentation for each requirement, which enables other members of the team to review it for validation
#### Once the design is approved the technical implementation begins. This is normally the shortest phase because research and design have been done in advance. Upon completion of full implementation, testing needs to take place before the product can be released to customers. The software testing team will use the design documents, personas and user case scenarios delivered by the product manager in order to create their test cases


## Spiral Method

#### The spiral model is a risk-driven process model generator for software projects. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models.

#### This model was first described by Barry Boehm in his 1986 paper Called A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement.

### Advantages 

#### High amount of risk analysis hence, avoidance of Risk is enhanced
#### Good for large and mission-critical projects
#### Additional Functionality can be added at a later date

### Disadvantages

#### Can be a costly model to use.
#### Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise.
#### Project’s success is highly dependent on the risk analysis phase

### How Risk Is Managed

#### The spiral model is a risk driven model which means that the overall success of a project highly depends on the risks analysis phase. Risk analysis requires specific expertise on every iteration. Firstly, it seems this model is complicated and hard to run but this model has its strong sides. 
#### For example, there’s a possibility to add some additional functionality at the last stages of product development. Since risk monitoring and regular expertise are core characteristics of this approach, the overall project becomes more transparent


## Prototyping 

#### Prototyping refers to the creating of software applications at early stages of development, for example, incomplete versions of the software program being developed. It is an activity that can occur in software development. It used to visualize some component of the software to limit the gap of misunderstanding the customer requirements by the development team. This also will reduce the iterations may occur in waterfall approach and hard to be implemented due to the inflexibility of the waterfall approach. So, when the final prototype is developed, the requirement is considered to be frozen

### Advantages

#### Reduced time and costs, but this can be a disadvantage if the developer loses time in developing the prototypes.
#### Improved and increased user involvement.

### Disadvantages 

#### Insufficient analysis· User confusion of prototype and finished system.
#### Developer misunderstanding of user objectives.
#### Excessive development time of the prototype.
#### Expense of implementing prototyping


## Evolutionary 

#### This Evolutionary method is based on the idea of rapidly developing an initial software implementation from very abstract specifications and modifying this according to your appraisal. Each program version inherits the best features from earlier versions. Each version is refined based upon feedback from yourself to produce a system which satisfies your needs. At this point the system may be delivered or it may be re-implemented using a more structured approach to enhance robustness and maintainability. Specification, development and validation activities are concurrent with strong feedback between each.

### Advantages 

#### This is the only method appropriate for situations where a detailed system specification is unavailable. 
#### Effective in rapidly producing small systems.
#### software with short life spans.
#### developing sub-components of larger systems.

### Disadvantages 

#### It is difficult to measure progress and produce documentation reflecting every version of the system as it evolves. 
#### This paradigm usually results in badly structured programs due to continual code modification. 
#### Production of good quality software using this method requires highly skilled and motivated programmers.
