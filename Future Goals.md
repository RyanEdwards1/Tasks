# Goals
I have many future goals that I have planned but I know that I just need to work at it slowly to achieve my goals and live in the moment and not to worry about getting there tomorrow but let it develop and always be improving them to keep yourself fighting for more. Firstly, I want to be able to have a successful company that is in the Computing industry developing all different types of stuff and making a positive name for myself. I also want to be able to earn a lot of money which goes with owning a company. I have grown up with my dad owning a business and he has tort me the ways to run a business in his field but that is a totally different field than Computing. But it has sure inspired me. 

The course that I am currently doing is boosting me to the goals a long way. The course is run like we are in a work place we have clients and we are learning how to manage them. Also, the course is giving us many opportunities to build contacts and build up a portfolio for are self. Once I am done with this course I have not decided whether I want to go back to University or to go in the computing world and see what I can do but that is somithng to think about in a couple of years 



The required skills for me to get to my goals are all being improved though the current course that I am doing. It tests my Programming skills, Team Work, Communication skills with clients and Experience in the IT field. All of these skills and more are needed to make It in the IT field these days

My personal performance objectives are to do well in current course to either go on to do another higher degree or to be able to go and get a good job in the IT industry so in this course I am aiming for at least MMM so then I am able to branch out and have many opportunities in a couple of years so I am not limited. Mostly I want to make the most out of these years as I have played a lot of money and donâ€™t want it to be a waste of time
